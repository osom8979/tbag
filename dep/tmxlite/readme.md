#### Description
A lightweight C++14 parsing library for tmx map files created with the Tiled map editor. Requires no external linking, all dependencies are included. Supports tmx maps up to 0.18 with CSV, zlib and base64 compression. The parser is renderer agnostic, and is cross platform on Windows, linux and OS X. It has also been successfully built for Android too.

As the library contains no specific rendering functions some example projects are included, along with the relevant CMake files. These are meant mostly for guidance and are not 100% optimised, but should get you off on the right foot when using libraries such as SFML or SDL2/OpenGL. Examples for any specific rendering library are welcome via a pull request.



#### Building
Either use the included Visual Studio project file if you are on Windows or the CMake file to generate project files for your compiler of choice. tmxlite can be built as both static or shared libraries, or simply include the source files in your own project.

#### Quick Start
There is a getting started page on the Github wiki [here](https://github.com/fallahn/tmxlite/wiki/Quick-Start).

#### Examples
Check out the following examples:
* [OpenGL Example](https://github.com/fallahn/tmxlite/tree/master/OpenGLExample)
* [SFML Example](https://github.com/fallahn/tmxlite/tree/master/SFMLExample)

#### API Documentation
Doxygen generated API documentation can be found online [here](https://codedocs.xyz/fallahn/tmxlite/) or generated with doxygen
using the doxy file in the tmxlite/documentation/ directory.

#### Important information 
tmxlite uses [pugixml](https://pugixml.org/) and [miniz](https://github.com/richgel999/miniz) which are included in the repository.
